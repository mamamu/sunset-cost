Ohio/NKy Local History Photo Search
=========================

Returns Title, Snippet, Url, and image src for google custom search engine results.

This search engine indexes a few OH/KY local history photo databases provided by various libraries.  

I am not returning alt text because many sites do not seem to provide it, thus the Title and snippet which appear to provide most of the information available about these photos.

This is not a really great search engine to look for Lolcats.  However, if you want to get lots of results, searching 'flood' will do it.  Other great searches:  'building','steamboat', and for a little fun 'zoo'.
